I like to get my gym session started by popping those airpods in and turn the music up, telling myself "the only way for my muscles to learn its new limit is to go to failure everytime on my last set. Remember that!". I then procede to get down and dirty. The gym is only one hobby and necessity that I get into when Im not coding. Mens Physic? Not yet? Ok with the sad face.</p>
